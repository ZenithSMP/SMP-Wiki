# 📑 Rules

#### 1.1 Unfair Gameplay Advantages

This includes hacking, cheating, and exploiting glitches/bugs. The only allowed exploits are: Breaking the Nether Roof, Entering the Nether Roof, and Duping Active TNT. Pretending to hack is also punishable.

#### 1.2 Griefing

Griefing, or claiming/setting a home or pwarp within 4 chunks of a claim, without permission, is not allowed. Lava casting is not allowed anywhere on the server.

#### 1.3 Scamming

Scamming is not allowed in any form, such as making a deal and not following through.

#### 1.4 Alts

Each player is only allowed two accounts. Using an alt to bypass punishment is forbidden.

#### 1.5 Trolling

Trolling players or staff in a hurtful or annoying way is not allowed. Light-hearted trolling among friends is fine.

#### 1.6 Fair PvP

Repeated targeting/harassment, teleporting with the intent to kill, and TP / portal traps are all disallowed. Pushing players outside of claims is not allowed.

### 2.0 Chat & Communication

#### 2.1 Respect

Zenith has zero tolerance for any harassment, disrespect, or hateful behaviour, including slurs and bigotry.

#### 2.2 Advertising

General talk about other servers (e.g. "I was playing Hypixel") is fine but direct advertisements such as "Join mc.serverip.com" and "Subscribe to xMineCrafter421x" are prohibited.

#### 2.3 Spamming

Spamming is not allowed in any form. Including, but not limited to:

* Chat spam - repeated or similar messages
* Letter spam - "aaaaaaaaaaaaa"
* Excessive caps - "ALWAYS TALKING LIKE THIS"

#### 2.4 Mini-modding

While we appreciate you trying to enforce our rules, let the staff team handle this. Either alert an online staff member or report the player via Discord.
